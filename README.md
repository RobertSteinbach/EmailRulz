This is a utility that I use to manage my emails.   See my LinkedIn article for usage.

To use this script, you will need to set the following environment variables:

IMAP_SERVER    mail.server.com
IMAP_LOGIN     usually your email@address.com
IMAP_PWD       email_password
EMAIL_ADDRESS  email@address.com


I suggest running in Docker for resilience.
